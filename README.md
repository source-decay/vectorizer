## About ##
A simple utility leveraging PHP in order to convert Bitmap images to Scalable
Vector Graphics.

Front end has been whipped up using the fabulous
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and a little jQuery.
As of right now, Vectorizer only runs on Linux. I'm sure with a little doing,
you can run it via Cygwin.

## Getting Started ##
1.  Requires Autotrace and PHP5. PHP5-dev would probably be nice to have.
`sudo apt-get install autotrace PHP5 PHP5-dev` (if apt is your package manager).

2.  From here, open your [browser of choice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and navigate to _index.html_

3.  The rest...well the rest is pretty self explanatory huh? Enjoy.
